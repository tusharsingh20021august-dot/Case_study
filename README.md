# Case Study 01 - Data Analysis Project

##  Project Overview
This project focus on analyzing transaction data to identify potential high-risk transactions based on factors like **Age**, **Transaction Amount**, and other attributes.  
The aim is to understand customer behavior and detect patterns that may indicate fraud or unusual activity and also understand the behaviour of customers..

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** Internal/Provided Dataset (data_full)
- **Columns Used:**
  - `Age`
  - `Amount`
  - `High_Risk`
  - Other relevant variables (as per dataset)

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Analysis
- Relationship between **Transaction Amount** and **Age**
- Detection of **High-Risk Transactions**
- Visualization of patterns using bar and pie charts
-  Find the average transaction amount per Age group

##  Visualizations
- Bar charts comparing amount vs age with risk levels
- Pie chart showing high vs low risk distribution

##  Insights
- [Add 2–3 insights you found from your analysis, e.g.:]
  - Younger age groups tend to have higher transaction risk.
  - The majority of transactions fall within a moderate amount range.
